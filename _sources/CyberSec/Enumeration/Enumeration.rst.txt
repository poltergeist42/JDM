Information gathering
---------------------

The Enumeration is the Information gathering process.

This process typically starts with information gathering, both passive and active, and focuses on
getting as much information about the target as possible. 

    :Passive information gathering:

        focuses on information which is publicly available such as company
        information, Whois information (a resource which may now have been blocked due to the EUâ€™s
        GDPR legislation), company e-mail addresses mentioned on the website, and so on.


    :Active information gathering:
    
        Collects information about the target by actually connecting and interacting with services
        on the target. Examples of active information gathering are port scans and the enumeration
        of services such as SMTP, SMB and SNMP.

This phase is probably the most important phase of the penetration test. The information gathered 
here will be the basis for all the following phases and, for this reason, they must be carried out
thoroughly, diligently and with great attention to detail. It is a good practice to revive a
previous search by including the new data collected. This phase is probably the most important phase
