   OSINT

         OSINT stands for **Open Source INTelligence**, which refers to any information that
         can legally be gathered from free, public sources about an individual or organization. In
         practice, that tends to mean information found on the internet, but technically any public
         information falls into the category of OSINT whether it’s books or reports in a public
         library, articles in a newspaper or statements in a press release.

         **What is OSINT Used For?**
         By gathering publicly available sources of information about a particular target an
         attacker – or friendly penetration tester – can profile a potential victim to better
         understand its characteristics and to narrow down the search area for possible
         vulnerabilities. Without actively engaging the target, the attacker can use the
         intelligence produced to build a threat model and develop a plan of attack. Targeted cyber
         attacks, like military attacks, begin with reconnaissance, and the first stage of digital
         reconnaissance is passively acquiring intelligence without alerting the target.

         Gathering OSINT on yourself or your business is also a great way to understand what
         information you are gifting potential attackers. Once you are aware of what kind of intel
         can be gathered about you from public sources, you can use this to help you or your
         security team develop better defensive strategies. What vulnerabilities does your public
         information expose ? What can an attacker learn that they might leverage in a social
         engineering or phishing attack ?

Pentest Distribution
--------------------

the distributions below have allmost all tools needed for a pentester. However it is possible to 
install individualy every tool in a non-dedicated os like Ubuntu, Debian and so on.

KALI Linux
==========

      * `Kali Linux`_

.. _`Kali Linux`: https://www.kali.org/


Kali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution geared towards various information
security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security Research, Computer Forensics and Reverse
Engineering.

Install and upgrade tools
-------------------------

On a new install of Kali, we need to update, upgrade and fix tools

      sudo apt update && apt install git
      cd /opt
      git clone https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali
      cd pimpmykali
      sudo ./pimpmykali.sh


Parrot Security OS
==================

:Liens_Web:
      * `Parrot os`_

.. _`Parrot Os`: https://www.parrotsec.org/

Parrot OS, is a GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian and designed with Security and Privacy in
mind. It includes a full portable laboratory for all kinds of cyber security operations, from
pentesting to digital forensics and reverse engineering, but it also includes everything needed to
develop your own software or keep your data secure.

Ennumeration tool
-----------------

Ennumeration tool can provide quickly all elements relative to a specific domain (or a web site).

Exemple of data type :
   * subdomain
   * email adress
   * directory and subdirectory
   * file list
   * and so on

theHarvester
============

      * `github theHaverester`_

.. _`github theHaverester` : https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester
.. _`theHaverester installation`: https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester/wiki/Installation

theHarvester is a very simple to use, yet powerful and effective tool designed to be used in the
early stages of a penetration test or red team engagement. Use it for open source
intelligence (OSINT) gathering to help determine a company's external threat landscape on the
internet. The tool gathers emails, names, subdomains, IPs and URLs using

   .. code-block:: shell
      :linenos:
      :force:

      # theHaverester manual
      python3 theHarvester.py -h

nmap

      * `nmap.org`_

.. _`nmap.org`: https://nmap.org/

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security
auditing. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the
network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating
systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and
dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine
against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary
packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line
Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible
data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff),
and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

   .. code-block:: shell
      :linenos:
      :force:

      # nmap
      nmap -A -p- -T4 <ip ou plage ip>

      # Par défaut, le scan s'effectue sur le TCP (-sS). Pour forcer le scan en UCP il faut
      # utiliser l'option -sU.
      #
      # -A: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute
      #
      # -p-: permet de scanner tous les ports si le deuxième "-" est absent, seuls les 1000
      #      Premiers ports seront scanner
      #
      # -T4: permet de déterminer la vitesse du scan 0-lent --> 5-rapide

:.. warning:: Attention il n'y a pas de time out en UDP. Le scan peux donc durer indéfiniment. Il
              est donc conseiller de ne scanner que les 1000 premiers ports.
