Elastic is a suite of software for distributed search and data analysis.

It includes the following components:

    * **Elasticsearch**: a distributed search and data analysis engine based on
      Apache Lucene.

    * **Kibana**: a web interface for visualizing and exploring data indexed in
      Elasticsearch.

    * **Logstash**: a tool for collecting, aggregating, and transforming data before indexing it in
      Elasticsearch.

    * **Beats**: lightweight agents for sending data to Logstash or Elasticsearch.

Kibana is the graphical user interface of the Elastic suite. It allows you to visualize data
indexed in Elasticsearch in the form of graphs, tables, and maps. Kibana also offers advanced
search and filtering capabilities for exploring data.

The Elastic suite is widely used in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environments
to collect, analyze, and visualize security event logs from various sources, such as firewalls,
intrusion detection systems, and servers.
